            <h2>What is celiac disease?</h2>
            <p>Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease that affects millions of Americans each year. It is estimated that about 1 in 100 people have celiac disease. </p>

            <img src="celiac.jpeg" alt="Healthy villi vs celiac villi">

            <p>When people with this disease eat gluten, their immune system acts abnormally. The immune system will launch an attack on the small intestine. This damages the villi that line the small intenstine, which makes it harder for the body to absorb the nutrients it needs. </p>
            <p>Celiac disease is a genetic disease. Oftentimes, the disease is developed later in life, and can be triggered by things like stress or illness. There is currently no cure for celiac disease.</p>
            <p>Celiac disease can be diagnosed by a blood test or by an edoscopy. Once diagnosed, it is absolutely necessary to adhere to a gluten free diet.</p>
